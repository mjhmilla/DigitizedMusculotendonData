# Description

This repository provides a data from the experimental muscle physiology literature that have been extracted from images.

# Quick Start

- Open matlab in the code directory
- Run main.m: you should see a plot with two panels: length vs. time and force vs. time 

# Usage

- To load other data sets you can use the loadDigitizedData function. Before using it, you must look at the csv file and enter in the names of the data series that you want to load (the 4th argument of loadDigitizedData).
- To find other data that might be interesting look at the png files in each folder. Every file has been named using the authors of the paper, the year published and the figure number: you will have no problem finding the paper using this data.
- To digitize your own data and/or edit the digitization use Engauge digitizer (https://github.com/markummitchell/engauge-digitizer)
